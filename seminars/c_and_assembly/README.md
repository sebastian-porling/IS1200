# Seminar 1 - C and Assembly programming

## Exercise 2

Make a single C statement that extracts the bits with index 17 to 13 from x and places them as the least significant bits in z, and extracts the least 3 significant bits of y and places them in the bits with index 7 to 5 in z. No other bits of z should be changed, besides the 8 bits that were extracted from x and y.

## Exercise 3

Make the function adder sum together two integer pointers and save the result to another pointer. 
The foo function will take in an integer and has the constant k. Call the adder function and return the value.

## Exercise 6

Create a C function named square_reverse with three parameters. The two first parameters are 64-bit floating-point pointers x and y, and the third parameter is an integer parameter called len. The function must not return any value. Pointer x points to an array of length len of floating-point values. The function reads out each element of the array, computes the square value of the element (x2) and then writes back the result into the array y in reverse order. That is, the output array y has also the length len.
